Harmful Internet Use (HIU) - survey data

Polish data focused on measuring the harmful Internet use (HIU) phenomenon using a novel peer-assessment approach. The dataset $D$ comprises responses from 267 participants, who collectively evaluated 1,518 peers. Of these participants, 185 were elementary school students who assessed 1,238 peers. In addition, 82 parents evaluated 280 children, including their own children or children they knew. The ages of the assessed individuals ranged from 10 to 22 years. Secondary school students aged 12 to 15 completed two questionnaires. Parents of the participating children were also encouraged to take part in the study.
